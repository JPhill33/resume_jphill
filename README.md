R blogdown resume

This repo is to create a personal website using the "hugo-resume" theme to provide a brief outline of my professional experience.  

This project includes continuous integration from your RStudio console to Github to Netlify.  This includes the use of docker and jenkins file.

Very good project to get familiar with Github and blogdown file structures.
